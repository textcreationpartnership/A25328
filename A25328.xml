            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Shall firſt relate his Actions in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> when King thereof, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his preſent Actions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which may ſerve as parallels to his former Actions.</p>
            <p>To begin, He that deſigns to be a Papiſt and a Slave, and that all his Poſterity ſhould be Papiſts and Slaves after him, may be ſuppoſed to fight for the Reſtauration of King <hi>James</hi> the Second, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: For he has broken his Oath before God and Man, and the Laws of the Land, and his repeated Promiſes of keeping them inviolable, by building of Popiſh Churches and Chappels, erecting of Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſetting up Colledges for Jeſuits, for corrupting of Youth, and making one of that Order a Privy Councellor and Miniſter of State; by making of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Judges and Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners, one whereof declared himſelf a Papiſt, which is againſt the expreſs Laws, for any Papiſts to be in any place or places of Truſt; by raiſing Perſons to Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Dignities who have no zeal for the Proteſtant Religion: Suſpending the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> turning out the Preſident and Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge from their Freeholds, and putting Papiſts in their Room, by commanding the Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, (which was contrary to Law) to be read in Churches, and citing all the Chancellours and Arch-Deacons of <hi>England,</hi> requiring them to certifie the names of all Clergy-men, who did or did not read the Declaration, though they were not enjoyned by their Biſhops who were their Ordinaries, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Honours and Eſtates of the Subjects and the Eſtabliſhed Religion to a Deſpotick and Arbitrary Government; ſeizing of the Charters of Towns, and putting in Popiſh Magiſtrates in many of them, by cauſing a great deal of Blood to be ſhed in divers places of the Kingdom againſt all the rules and forms of Law, not ſuffering the Perſons accuſed to plead in their own defence: By putting the Adminiſtration of Juſtice in <hi>Papiſts</hi> hands, arming the Papiſts, and putting them in the greateſt places of Truſt both by Sea and Land, as well Strangers and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as <hi>Engliſh:</hi> By impriſoning of the Biſhops for their humble and lawful Petition, and afterwards trying of them: By treating of a Peer as Criminal, for ſpeaking the Truth, in ſaying that the Subjects were not bound to obey the Orders of a Popiſh Juſtice of the Peace, and requiring all perſons that were in any Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Eſteem, to declare that they would concur in the Repeal of the Teſt and Penal Laws, and give their Vote for ſuch Parliament-men who would be for repealing of them, and turning out all perſons in places of Truſt, who would not concur in it, and putting thoſe in their places who promiſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and many of them profeſſed Papiſts: By ſending an Ambaſſadour to <hi>Rome,</hi> and receiving one from thence, and admitting of vaſt numbers of Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits, Dominicans and Fryers, into <hi>England:</hi> By making of Popiſh Councellors, Popiſh Lieutenants of the Counties, High Sheriffs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sheriffs, and Popiſh Juſtices of the Peace: By keeping up a ſtanding Army, with Popiſh Officers: By Invading the Fundamental Conſtitution of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and altering it from a legal limited Monarchy, to an Arbitrary Deſpotick Power, and hath exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame, to the ſubverſion of the Proteſtant Religion, and the violation of the Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that Nation, and perverting all the ends and deſigns of Government, and declaring of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power there, and that all the Subjects were bound to obey him without reſerve, and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding the Proteſtant Officers and Souldiers in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and putting in Papiſts in all places of Truſt, and turning out Proteſtants, and taking away Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Eſtates, becauſe they had them contrary to Juſtice or Reaſon, only becauſe the good Catholicks cut a little parcel of about one hundred and fifty thouſand Hereticks Throats, and made Candles of their Greaſe: I had almoſt forgot one thing not worth ſpeaking of, the Diſpencing with the Laws of the Land. Theſe inſtances may ſuffice, to ſhew his deſire, (to uſe his own words) to uſe no other than Lenity and Mercy, and are very proper to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the following Speech which he made to the Council, upon his coming to the Crown, <hi>February</hi> the 6th 1684, with his after aſſurances.</p>

            <p>In his Speech to the Parliament, <hi>May</hi> the 30th 1685. he ſays that he has an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Heart, (if he had ſaid
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48482:2"/>and a Popiſh Conſcience) as much as any Man, and will go as far when there is occaſion in defence and ſupport thereof (we ſhould have known what to truſt to.) In his Speech to the Parliament after the defeat of <hi>Monmouth, November</hi> the 9th 1685. ſpeaking of the Popiſh Officers that were in the Army, (I will neither expoſe them to diſgrace nor my ſelf to the want of them) knowing that without ſuch he could never bring about his Deſigns, concluding with theſe words, I will ever make you all returns of Kindneſs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, with Reſolution to venture my own Life in the defence of the true Intereſt of this Kingdom. And though the Parliament Addreſt him the 17th following, deſiring him to lay aſide thoſe Popiſh Officers, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to Law, yet he would by no means hearken to it, but was very angry with them, in his Speech in anſwer to their Addreſs, concluding with theſe words; I will be ſteady in all the Promiſes I have made you, and be very juſt to my word in every one of my Speeches.</p>
            <p>But in his Speech to Father <hi>Clare</hi> he ſaid, he would either Convert <hi>England,</hi> or dye a Martyr; and that he had rather dye to morrow, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion being wrought, than Reign fifty years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, in Happineſs and Proſperity.</p>
            <p>To begin with his preſent Actions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his arrival at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the few Proteſtants that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Employs were turned out, not a Proteſtant was allowed to ſit in Council, or bear Arms, the Lord <hi>Granard,</hi> Lord Chief-Juſtice <hi>Keating,</hi> Sir <hi>John Davis,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Newcomen,</hi> Collonel <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> &amp;c. were all turned out, and none permitted to hold any Place but Papiſts, tho' theſe Gentlemen were ſo true to the King, and went ſo far to ſerve him, as made them ſuſpected to be of his Religion. See his gratitude to the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> who coming with him from <hi>France,</hi> died a Proteſtant at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and was ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably poor as to want common neceſſaries; and being dead, was buried at the charge of a Charitable Prelate there: but to proceed, the Lord Viſcount <hi>Mazerine</hi> hath been plundered in Plate, Money, Houſehold Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the value of near twenty thouſand pounds, and others proportionable, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſeveral Declarations from <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> to the Contrary; and upon a modeſt computation they have plundred already in Money, Plate, Houſehold-Goods, Horſes, Corn and Hay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the value of two hundred thouſand pounds. One Mr. <hi>Robert Boroughs</hi> an Attorney, and Rich, had all his ſubſtance taken from him, and turned out of doors, who died for hunger and cold, and they have killed many perſons in cold blood without any provocation given; for example, the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> took one <hi>Dean Dixies</hi> Son, and another young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, tho not in Arms, and hanged them upon a Sign-poſt. Upon King <hi>James</hi>'s arrival in <hi>Ireland</hi> the Proteſtants thought they ſhould have had ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs for the Robbing and Pillaging of their Cattle and moveable goods, and other inhumanities which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Soldiers daily committed on them, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for the future; but behold the lenity and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this King, who upon ſeveral complaints made to him, would anſwer, that he would do for them what he could, but they never received any further ſatisfaction or Juſtice; particularly the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> cut off a Gentlemans head in the North, and made his own Son carry it on a Pike in triumph before his Regiment. Upon Complaint of this to the King, he ſeemed mightily diſpleaſed, yet the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> carried the Sword before him the very next day. If we did relate all the diſmal relations we have from thence it would make a Volume. Theſe are mercies fit to be acted by none but Papiſts, and Popiſh Kings. An <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lord who came with King <hi>James</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> ſpeaking to a Clergy-man of <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſaid, That King <hi>James</hi> can never expect poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Kingdoms by the Proteſtants means, unleſs tied and ſettered with Conditions which he cannot, nor ſhall not obſerve to them: 'tis by the force of Arms of his good Catholicks, and by aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>France</hi> that he deſigns to regain his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and then he comes in free and boundleſs, like an abſolute Conquerour, and ſhall afterwards do what he pleaſes; we have had one taſte of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his Intentions, as well before, as when King; and he that deſires another, in God's name let him go to him or to the <hi>French</hi> King, 'tis much as one: but ſuppoſe he's ſincere now, and that he repents of all his former illegalities and miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and reſolves for the future never to commit the like, what ſecurity can he give us that he'll always continue ſo, to govern us according to the Rights, Priviledges, and Laws of the Land? Certainly he can give us none beſides his Oath or Promiſe, which ſignifies nothing, for it's impoſſible for him to keep them without damning his own Soul; and can any man believe he'll damn his Soul to keep his Oath or Promiſe, when he ſhall go to Heaven for breaking of them (according to the Doctrine of their Church?) but what ſignifies it to break two or three Promiſes when every body breaks them, or an Oath or ſo, 'tis in faſhion now? as for the <hi>French</hi> King, he has kept his Oaths and Promiſes in ſuch an extraordinary manner, that all the Hiſtories now extant cannot come near to a Parallel, and our King <hi>James</hi> has only been there to learn a few of his Morals, and is coming to teach 'em with <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Dragoons, intermixt with a little Liberty, ſuch as we nor our Fathers were able to bear. And now good Folks prepare your ſelves for this happineſs, for he's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with open arms and ſtretched out hands to make ye happy (that is Papiſts) whether ye will or no, and I doubt not but that you'll ſee your own happineſs which is coming upon you like a Torrent, and prepare for it accordingly.</p>
            <p>I hope all the People in <hi>England</hi> will make a juſt judgment of what has been ſaid and conſider what they may expect from ſuch a King who is ſo much Jeſuited.</p>
            <p>All the World cannot but acknowledge that this great Revolution has been by the miraculous Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Almighty God, and we ought (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did) to bleſs God that we are once delivered out of the mouth of the Lyon, and ſhould we not affront that Providence if we ſhould let him into our Boſoms again? would it not be juſt with God to let him deſtroy us? but can we be guilty of ſuch a notorious folly or madneſs, as to maintain the Ambition of the late King <hi>James,</hi> to the ruine and deſtruction of our ſelves, which can be nothing elſe if we contribute to reſtore him to the Crown; on the contrary, if we deſign to be happy, and that our Poſterity ſhould be happy after us, in enjoying the Goſpel in its purity and its true Religion, and what the Laws of Nature and our Countrey have conferred on us, we ought to oppoſe the late King <hi>James</hi> as the common Enemy of our Religion and Liberty, for this is the time to Entail happineſs on our ſelves and our Poſterity: <hi>Now, and Ever, Now, or Never.</hi>
